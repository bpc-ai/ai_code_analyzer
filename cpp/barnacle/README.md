-main.cpp-
This code demonstrates the usage of classes and multiple files in C++. It defines a Rectangle class with member variables width and length, and member functions to set and get these variables, and calculate the area. The main function prompts the user to choose between finding the area or volume, then prompts for user input to calculate the area or volume of a rectangle or box using the Rectangle and Box classes. The program validates the user input to ensure only valid values are used.

-box.cpp-
This code defines a C++ class called "Box" with methods to set and retrieve the dimensions of a box (width, length, and height) and calculate its volume. The code includes a header file "box.h", and the "using namespace std" statement is used to avoid typing "std::" before using standard library functions.

The methods in this class are:

    setWidthBox: sets the width of the box
    setLengthBox: sets the length of the box
    setHeightBox: sets the height of the box
    getWidthBox: returns the width of the box
    getLengthBox: returns the length of the box
    getHeightBox: returns the height of the box
    getVolume: calculates and returns the volume of the box based on its width, length, and height.

-box.h-
This code declares a C++ class named Box that has private data members representing the width, length, and height of a box. It also includes public member functions that allow setting and getting the values of these data members, as well as a function that calculates and returns the volume of the box.

The #ifndef and #define preprocessor directives are used to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file in the same translation unit, ensuring that the class is defined only once.
